### SGA 0.5 Track:  FrontEnd
Name: MOSES, Tosin Israel .
Project Title: Design and development of beta-search-react! . 

### What problem are you solving?
It is to be pointed out that most users do not get what they want when there is lots of information on a website, so this website is channeled to simply help users search for their preference restaurant.


###  What solution are you offering?
The following highlight the best three solutions to the aforementioned problem:
As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants.
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API.
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using filter.

###  Scope
The project will consist of creating an easy to navigate platform that users will use to search for restaurants and with varying options. The app will also contain other functionalities where users can simply sort their search in terms of best match, highest rated and most reviewed. The project will be completed on the 1st of August, 2019.
